OSDL DBT-3 QuickStart
=====================

Requirements
------------

 - PostgreSQL or MySQL
 - sysstat
 - procmail


How to install
--------------

 (1) Run autogen to create a configure script.

       $ sh autogen.sh

 (2) Run configure with several options as you need.

     To configure with MySQL database, you can specify several MySQL
     options:

       $ ./configure --with-mysql --with-mysql-datadir=/tmp/mydata

     To configure with PostgreSQL database, you can also specify
     PostgreSQL options:

       $ ./configure --with-postgresql

     For more details about configure options, run with --help option:

       $ ./configure --help

 (3) Run make to build dbgen, qgen, and other tools.

       $ make

 (4) Install the kit

       $ make install


How to run
----------

 (1) Make sure that a dbt3 profile has been create correctly.

     If you're using PostgreSQL, you have to specify PGHOME and PGDATA
     correctly in `dbt3_pgsql_profile' in the `examples/pgsql' directory.

     If you're using MySQL, you have to specify MYDATA correctly in
     `dbt3_mysql_profile' in the `examples/mysql' directory.

     `DSS_PATH' is a directory that holds data files generated by

     Other variables need not to be modified by hand.

     Source the file, e.g. depending on your shell:

       $ . dbt3_pgsql_profile

     or

       $ source dbt3_mysql_profile

 (2) Run `dbt3-run-workload' to run test workloads.

     Now, you have been prepared to load data into the database and run
     workloads. Run `dbt3-run-workload' in the `scripts' directory.

       $ dbt3-run-workload -a pgsql -f 1 -o /tmp/results

     The `-f 1' parameter specifies that a 1GB database scale factor will be
     used.

     The `-o' flag specifies the output directory for the results.

     The datafiles will be created if there are no files in the `DSS_PATH'.

     You can determine the progress by referring 'time_statistics' table
     in the test database while running those workloads.

       $ psql -c 'select * from time_statistics' dbt3
        (with PostgreSQL)

 (4) Make sure that `index.html', `q_time.png' and other result files have been
     generated in the output directory, and you can view the report in HTML
     format by opening `index.html' with your browser.

       $ ls -lF /tmp/results
       total 40
       -rw-rw-r-- 1 snaga snaga  387 Apr 29 04:37 config.txt
       -rw-rw-r-- 1 snaga snaga 1108 Apr 29 04:39 index.html
       drwxrwxr-x 3 snaga snaga 4096 Apr 28 01:33 load/
       drwxrwxr-x 6 snaga snaga 4096 Apr 29 04:39 power1/
       -rw-rw-r-- 1 snaga snaga  537 Apr 29 04:39 q_time.input
       -rw-rw-r-- 1 snaga snaga 2634 Apr 29 04:38 q_time.out
       -rw-rw-r-- 1 snaga snaga  332 Apr 29 04:39 q_time_p.data
       -rw-rw-r-- 1 snaga snaga 4032 Apr 29 04:39 q_time.png
       -rw-rw-r-- 1 snaga snaga   10 Apr 28 01:33 seed
       drwxrwxr-x 4 snaga snaga 4096 Apr 29 04:39 throughput1/
       $

     DBT-3 consists of three tests, Load Test, Power Test and
     Throughput Test, so there are three subdirectories in
     the result directory by default.
