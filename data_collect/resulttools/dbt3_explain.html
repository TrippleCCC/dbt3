<h1>DBT-3 Test</h1>
<p><a name="DBT-3"><strong>DBT-3</strong></a><br>
DBT-3 test consists of the Load test followed by the Performance Test</p>

<p><a name="Load"><strong>Load Test</strong></a><br>
The Load test begins with the creation of the database tables and includes all the activity required to bring the database to the stage immediately before the Performance test</p>

<p><a name="Performance"><strong>Performance Test</strong></a><br>
The Performance test includes one execution of Power test and one execution of Throughput test.</p>

<p><a name="Power_Test"><strong>Power Test</strong></a><br>
The Power test is designed to measure the raw query execution power.  It starts with refresh function 1(inserts), followed by one query stream and refresh function 2(deletes).  There is one active user connected to the database during the test.</p>

<p><a name="Throughput_Test"><strong>Throughput Test</strong></a><br>
The Throughput test is designed to measure the ability of the system to process the most queries in multi-user environment. Multiple query streams and refresh streams are executed simultaneously</p>

<p><a name="Query_Stream"><strong>Query Stream</strong></a><br>
Query stream is a sequential execution of a set of the twenty-two queries submitted by a single user</p>

<p><a name="Refresh_Stream"><strong>Refresh Stream</strong></a><br>
Refresh Stream is the sequential execution of an integral number of pairs of refresh functions</p>

<p><a name="Refresh_Function_1"><strong>Refresh Function 1</strong></a><br>
Refresh Function 1 adds new sales information to the database.</p>

<p><a name="Refresh_Function_2"><strong>Refresh Function 2</strong></a><br>
Refresh Function 2 removes old sales information from the database.</p>

<p><a name="Queries"><strong>Queries</strong></a><br>
There are twenty-two queries designed to answer questions representing complex business analysis applications</p>

<p><a name="Power"><strong>Query Processing Power</strong></a><br>
The results of the power test are used to compute DBT-3 Query Processing Power at the chosen database size.  The unit of the power@size is 'queries per hour'.  The higher the Query Processing Power, the better the performance.</p>

<p><a name="Throughput"><strong>Throughput Numerical Quantity</strong></a><br>
The results of the throughput test are used to compute DBT-3 Throughput at the chosen database size. The units of throughput@size is 'queries per hour'.  The higher the Throughput Numerical Quantity, the better the performance.</p>

<p><a name="Composite"><strong>Composite</strong></a><br>
The numerical quantities DBT-3 Power and Throughtput are combined to form the DBT-3 composite-query-per-hour performance metrics. The units of throughput@size is 'queries per hour'.  The higher the Composite number, the better the performance.</p>
